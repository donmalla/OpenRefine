OpenRefine-HD is a Big Data extension to OpenRefine - power tool that allows you to load data, understand it,
clean it up, reconcile it to master database, and augment it with data coming from
Freebase or other web sources. OpenRefine-HD reads data present in HDFS cluster, and applies transformations on them, by spinning Mapreduce jobs. The goal of OpenRefine-HD is to provide a scalable platform for cleaning the data, do exploratory data analysis , sample the data and perform model scoring, all these within the OpeRefine-HD tool.
